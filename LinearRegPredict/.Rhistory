# The model fits the data well because we see that the R2 value is high, which indicates a strong fit. RSE is also low which means that the residual error doesn't vary a lot, and similar with RMSE which means that the average residual error also doesn't vary as much. RSE and RMSE are close to each other which i will infer as it meaning that between the different residuals the average and error don't deviate a lot. Essentially, these are signs of a model with a good fit.

# The distribution is very close to a Gaussian one. It is very slightly skewed to the left. What I can say about the residuals is that most of them are very close to the mean.
# From part a-ii, the most significant predictors are weight, year, and origin.
